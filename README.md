This python program generates a motorcycle graph of a small, simple (no holes) polygon. The number of sides is expected to be less than 100 or so. The points are assumed defined counter-clockwise, the first point is duplicated at the end, and there are assumed to be no occurance of successive colinear corner triples (i.e., no redundant corners). YOu will need to set the bounds of the graph appropriatly. # Motorcycle-graph-generator
