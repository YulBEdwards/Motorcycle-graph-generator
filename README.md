This python program generates a motorcycle graph of a small, simple (no holes) polygon. The number of sides is expected to be less than 100 or so. The points are assumed defined counter-clockwise, the first point is duplicated at the end, and there are assumed to be no occurance of successive colinear corner triples (i.e., no redundant corners).# Motorcycle-graph-generator
